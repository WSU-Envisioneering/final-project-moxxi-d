    <h2>Envisioneering</h2>
    <p>I joined Envisioneering to get free college credits in the beginning. Since joining, I've learned so many new skills and met a bunch of great people. The mentors were amazing and the program overall was really fun. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to. It was a great decision and a great way to spend a summer.</p>

      <h3>What Did We Learn?</h3>
      <p>Throughout the program, I learned a lot that I never knew. I knew nothing about coding starting out. Because I knew little on the topic of coding, it was a bit hard starting out. As the program kept going, I learned so much. I learned how to do HTML coding along with CSS coding in WEB 1400. In CS 1030, I learned about the history of computers and coding, as well as the make-up of a computer. In CS 1030, I also learned about Python.</p>

      <h3>The People</h3>
      <p>When it comes to the people in Envisioneering, they make it 10x better. The teachers are very kind and understanding of us learning. They made the course easy to understand and interactive. The mentors made going through the assignments even better. Whenever there was a small issue in a code, they were there to help. They were there as people, too, and interacted and had fun with us. The people in the class alongside me were so amazing. Getting to know them and go on field trips with them was a lot of fun. </p>
